# OS2ai GitOps usage

To install OS2ai with this GitOps [template](https://github.com/OS2ai/helm-deployments), you need to have a
Kubernetes cluster with the following installed:

* Helm 3
* [Ceph](https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.12/Getting-Started/quickstart/) filesystem

This deployment documentation must be followed and executed in the exact order as described below. This is
due to some services depending on other services being ready before they can be installed.

In particular, `ArgoCD` needs to be installed before `Argo resources`, `sealed secrets` etc.

The application also requires generation of API keys, etc., and that you use sealed secrets to store them before a
given service can be installed. Some services also require keys/secrets from one service to communicate with another.

Also, because all configuration is stored in GitOps as code, you will need to update secrets and URLs to match your
domain and setup. This document will guide you through the process of setting up OS2ai.

## Variables

Throughout this installation documentation, some values are used multiple times. These values are defined in the
following variables:

* `FQDN`: The fully qualified domain name of the cluster (e.g. aarhus.dk).
* `CERT_MAIL`: The email address used to request a certificate from Let's Encrypt.
* `HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN`: The Hugging Face token used to download the model from Hugging Face.
* `VLLM_API_KEY`: The API key used to communicate with the vLLM service.
* `LITELLM_MASTER_KEY`: API master key to communicate with LiteLLM.
* `DOCINGESTION_API_KEY`: API key used to communicate with the document ingestion service.
* `LITELLM_DATABASE_PASSWORD`: Password for the LiteLLM database.
* `SEARXNG_SECRET`: Secret for the SearXNG service.
* `WEBUI_SECRET`: Secret for the Open WebUI service.
* `WEBUI_DATABASE_PASSWORD`: Password for the Open WebUI database.

They are used with this notation `<LITELLM_MASTER_KEY>` in the configuration snippets.

If you want to randomly generate keys and password, you can use this command:

```shell
echo "$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-f0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1)"
```

## Bootstrap continuous deployment

The first step is
to [create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
a new GitHub repository based on this [template repository](https://github.com/OS2ai/helm-deployments).

### ArgoCD

For continuous development and using GitOps to handle updates and configuration
changes, [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) needs to be bootstrapped into the cluster.

To do so, configure the domain in `applications/argo-cd/values.yaml`:

```yaml
global:
  domain: argo.<FQDN>
```

Then install ArgoCD using the following commands:

```shell
helm repo add argocd https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
helm repo update
cd applications/argo-cd
helm dependency build
kubectl create namespace argo-cd
helm template argo-cd . -n argo-cd | kubectl apply -f -
```

Because we are installing the ingress controller with ArgoCD, it is only accessable by using port forwarding at this
point in the installation:

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/argo-cd-argocd-server -n argo-cd 8443:443
```

You can ensure that ArgoCD is running by opening the ingress URL:

```shell
open http://127.0.0.1:8443
```

You can log into the web-based user interface with the username `admin` and get the password with this command:

```shell
kubectl -n argo-cd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d; echo
```

Optionally, [Authentik](https://goauthentik.io/) can be installed as a single-sign-on (SSO) provider for
the internal services in the cluster. See the [Authentik](authentik.md) for more information.

### Argo resources (applications)

Now we can install the Argo resources that define the applications and their configuration. But first, we need to
change the repository URL to our own repository.

Edit `applications/argo-cd-resources/values.yaml`:

```yaml
repoUrl: https://github.com/os2ai/<YOUR REPO>.git
```

Edit `applications/cert-manager/templates/cluster-issuer.yaml` and change the email address to your own:

```yaml
spec:
  acme:
    email: <CERT_MAIL>
 ```

Now commit the changes to the repository before the next step in Argo installation, which is to install the resources:

```shell
cd applications/argo-cd-resources/
helm template argo-cd-resources . -n argo-cd | kubectl apply -f -
```

This will install all the applications from `applications/argo-cd-resources/values.yaml` that are set to
`automated: true` which are all the applications that do not need configuration changes.

All other applications will need to have their configuration updated and committed to the repository
before they can be installed.

## Observability

Loki, Tempo, and Alloy are automatically installed by ArgoCD above as they do not require configuration changes. But
Grafana needs some basic domain name and URL configuration.

Edit `applications/prometheus-stack/values.yaml` and change the following:

```yaml
grafana:
  ingress:
    hosts:
      - obs.<FQDN>
    tls:
      hosts:
        - obs.<FQDN>

  additionalDataSources:
    grafana.ini:
      server:
        domain: obs.<FQDN>
        root_url: https://obs.<FQDN>
```

Change `automated` to true in `applications/argo-cd-resources/values.yaml` for the `prometheus-stack` application.

You can access Grafana by opening the ingress URL:

```yaml
kubectl get ingress -n monitoring -o jsonpath='{.items[*].spec.rules[*].host}' | tr ' ' '\n' | xargs -I {} open "https://{}"
```

Log into Grafana with the username `admin` and password:

```yaml
kubectl get secret -n monitoring prometheus-stack-grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 -d; echo
```

## Sealed Secrets

Before installing the rest of the applications, we need to install `kubeseal` to generate sealed secrets that can be
safely committed to public GitHub repositories. Yes, one can reconfigure ArgoCD to use private repositories, but one
would still use sealed secrets to protect these secrets. Accidental exposure happens, and human errors occur, hence
the need for sealed secrets.

Read more about [sealed secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets).

### Install kubeseal

Follow the [kubeseal](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets?tab=readme-ov-file#kubeseal) install guide based on
which system you are on to install the CLI tool.

### Seal a secret (just an example)

You can place the unsealed secret anywhere you want, but this repository has the path `applications/**/local-secrets`
in `.gitignore`. So with this in mind, the `kubeseal` commands would be in the form:

```shell
kubectl create -f local-secrets/example-secrets.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubeseal --format yaml > templates/sealed-example-secrets.yaml
```

With an unsealed secret like this (here for LiteLLM):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: example-secrets
  namespace: example
stringData:
  SECRET_NAME: super_secret_key
```

## vLLM (Mistral 24B model)

Read more about [vLLM production stack](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack).

If you want to use a locally hosted model on local hardware in the cluster, you need to configure the vLLM application,
which requires you to first create a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) account. Models are downloaded from here,
and it's free. Create an account and generate an access token.

Create an unsealed secret for `hf-secret.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: hf-secret
  namespace: vllm
stringData:
  TOKEN: <HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN>
```

Seal it:

```shell
kubectl create -f local-secrets/hf-secret.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubeseal --format yaml > templates/sealed-hf-secret.yaml
```

Next, create a secret for the vLLM API. This key is used internally in the cluster to communicate with the vLLM service,
and you should generate a random key:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: vllm-secret
  namespace: vllm
stringData:
  KEY: <VLLM_API_KEY>
```

Seal it:

```shell
kubectl create -f local-secrets/vllm-secret.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubeseal --format yaml > templates/sealed-vllm-secret.yaml
```

Change `automated` to true in `applications/argo-cd-resources/values.yaml` for the `vllm` application. Add, commit, and
push the changes to have Argo deploy vLLM automatically. **Note** that it may take some time to deploy vLLM the
first time, as it downloads the model from Hugging Face and loads it into GPU memory.

## LiteLLM

This is a LLM proxy that can be used to generate virtual API keys and keep track of token costs. It is able to talk to
many different LLM servicing frameworks. It extends the ability to connect to Azure, Claude, and OpenAI APIs, which are
not necessarily supported by the frontend (Open WebUI). It also has a built-in, simple chat interface which can be used
to debug connections to models.

It is also the place to set up guardrails. We currently ship with a single custom guardrail ensuring that the
context window for Mistral is not overflowed. It does so by ensuring that the context window is not larger than the
model's
maximum context window. So, if you are using another model, you may need to adjust the guardrail configuration.

[LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/) uses a PostgreSQL database to store the virtual API keys (if used) and usage
statistics. So we need to create a secret for the database credentials:

Create the file `local-secrets/litellm-cloudnative-pg-secret.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: cloudnative-pg-cluster-litellm
  namespace: litellm
stringData:
  username: litellm
  password: <LITELLM_DATABASE_PASSWORD>
```

Seal it:

```shell
kubectl create -f local-secrets/litellm-cloudnative-pg-secret.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubeseal --format yaml > templates/sealed-cloudnative-pg-secret.yaml
```

Next, we need to set a master key and API keys for the configured end-points. Create the file
`local-secrets/litellm-secrets.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: litellm-secrets
  namespace: litellm
stringData:
  PROXY_MASTER_KEY: <LITELLM_MASTER_KEY>
  CA_VLLM_LOCAL_API_KEY: <VLLM_API_KEY>
```

Seal it:

```shell
kubectl create -f local-secrets/litellm-secrets.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubeseal --format yaml > templates/sealed-litellm-secrets.yaml
```

**NOTE**: If you want to access the web UI, you need to edit `litellm-values.yaml` by enabling ingress and setting a
domain name to access it. You can use the master key from the `litellm-secrets` secret as the password for the web UI.

Change `automated` to true in `applications/argo-cd-resources/values.yaml` for the `litellm` application. Add,
commit, and push the changes to have Argo deploy LiteLLM automatically.

## Document ingestion route (optional recommended)

This is a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) proxy that tries to find the best way to extract texts for RAG before
embedding, when files and web search results are processed. Currently, it supports Tika for the backend and makes some
decisions about whether to extract clean text or Markdown. The idea is that it should be used later on to route input
data to the correct extractor based on, e.g., file types, etc. It could use tools such as Marker, MarkItDown, Docling,
and Tika.

It is optional, as Open WebUI can talk directly to Tika or Docling, but it is recommended for better text extraction.

Create the file `local-secrets/secrets.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: secrets
  namespace: doc-ingestion
stringData:
  API_KEY: <DOCINGESTION_API_KEY>
```

Seal it:

```shell
kubectl create -f local-secrets/secrets.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubeseal --format yaml > templates/sealed-secrets.yaml
```

Change `automated` to true in `applications/argo-cd-resources/values.yaml` for the `doc-ingestion` application. Add,
commit, and push the changes to have Argo deploy automatically.

## SearXNG (optional recommended)

[SearXNG](https://docs.searxng.org/) is a metasearch engine and is used to find relevant documents for a given
query search on the internet. Open WebUI can be configured to use a range of online web search pages, but only one at a
time. SearXNG allows us to search a huge range of known search engines while also allowing the addition of custom
search engines.

It also ensures searches are anonymous and untraceable from one query to the next, thereby ensuring that one does not
affect another. It filters out paid results and AI-generated results.

In Aarhus, we have made an engine that searches [https://aarhus.dk/search](https://aarhus.dk/search) and places its
results high in the final federated search. For reference,
see the [implementation](https://github.com/OS2ai/aarhusai-docker/blob/main/.docker/searxng/aarhus.py).

Create the file `local-secrets/searxng-secret.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: searxng-secrets
  namespace: searxng
stringData:
  SEARXNG_SECRET: <SEARXNG_SECRET>
```

Seal it:

```shell
kubectl create -f local-secrets/searxng-secret.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubeseal --format yaml > templates/sealed-searxng-secret.yaml
```

Change `automated` to true in `applications/argo-cd-resources/values.yaml` for the `searxng` application. Add,
commit, and push the changes to have Argo deploy automatically.

## Open WebUI

[Open WebUI](https://docs.openwebui.com/) is the main application that binds the whole OS2ai stack together by
providing the framework to chat with the LLM(s) and making RAG-based models. It has a lot of features that can be
controlled through [environment variables](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/env-configuration).
The deployment comes with some default values that match the current OS2ai setup, but you can change them
to fit your needs in `values.yaml`.

Also note, that `was-middleware.yaml` found in the openwebui templates folder should be updated to match your
municipality's accessibility statement(s) (tilgængelighedserklæringer).

First you need to update the ingress in `applications/openwebui/values.yaml` to match your domain name. You also have to
read through this file and update the settings to match your needs.

**Note**: You also need to allow "Sign-up" to allow the creation of the first user as _admin_ in the system (setting
`ENABLE_SIGNUP` to `True`). You can make another deployment right after to disable the sign-up.

```yaml
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    class: "traefik"
    annotations:
      cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt
      traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.middlewares: openwebui-was-redirect@kubernetescrd
    host: ai.<FQDN>
    additionalHosts: [ ]
    tls:
      - hosts:
          - ai.<FQDN>
        secretName: ai.<FQDN>-tls
    existingSecret: ""
    extraLabels: { }
```

Next create the file `local-secrets/openwebui-secrets.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: openwebui-secrets
  namespace: openwebui
stringData:
  WEBUI_SECRET_KEY: <WEBUI_SECRET_KEY>
  OPENAI_API_KEY: <LITELLM_MASTER_KEY>
  RAG_OPENAI_API_KEY: <VLLM_API_KEY>
  EXTERNAL_DOCUMENT_LOADER_API_KEY: <DOCINGESTION_API_KEY>
```

Seal it:

```shell
kubectl create -f local-secrets/openwebui-secrets.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubeseal --format yaml > templates/sealed-openwebui-secrets.yaml
```

Create the file `local-secrets/cloudnative-pg-cluster-openwebui-secret.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: cloudnative-pg-cluster-openwebui
  namespace: openwebui
stringData:
  username: openwebui
  password: <WEBUI_DATABASE_PASSWORD>
```

Seal it:

```shell
kubectl create -f local-secrets/cloudnative-pg-cluster-openwebui-secret.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubeseal --format yaml > templates/sealed-cloudnative-pg-cluster-openwebui-secret.yaml
```

Change `automated` to true in `applications/argo-cd-resources/values.yaml` for the `openwebui` application. Add,
commit, and push the changes to have Argo deploy automatically.
